# PowerWheelController
Project to control a power wheel kids car with an Arduino Mega 2560.

Basically the project scope looks something like this:

Meaning the car was already remote controlled and will be also remote controlled in future.

Parts you will need to rebuild this project:

* 2 channel relay module
* at least 2 channel mosfet module (I used a yymos-4)
* 2 motor driver modules (BTS7960)
* bluetooth module hc-06
* sound buzzer
* DC-DC Converter 16-30V -> 12V
* DC-DC Converter 16-20V -> 5V
* 3 ultrasonic sensors hc-sr04
* display lcd2004
* some buttons 
* alarm flash lights as much as you want :-)  
* cables/wires/
